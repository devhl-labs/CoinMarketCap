 * CoinMarketCap Cryptocurrency API Documentation
 *
 * # Introduction The CoinMarketCap API is a suite of high-performance RESTful JSON endpoints that are specifically designed to meet the mission-critical demands of application developers, data scientists, and enterprise business platforms.  This API reference includes all technical documentation developers need to integrate third-party applications and platforms. Additional answers to common questions can be found in the [CoinMarketCap API FAQ](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/faq).  # Quick Start Guide  For developers eager to hit the ground running with the CoinMarketCap API here are a few quick steps to make your first call with the API.  1. **Sign up for a free Developer Portal account.** You can sign up at [pro.coinmarketcap.com](https://pro.coinmarketcap.com) - This is our live production environment with the latest market data. Select the free `Basic` plan if it meets your needs or upgrade to a paid tier. 2. **Copy your API Key.** Once you sign up you'll land on your Developer Portal account dashboard. Copy your API from the `API Key` box in the top left panel. 3. **Make a test call using your key.** You may use the code examples provided below to make a test call with your programming language of choice. This example [fetches all active cryptocurrencies by market cap and return market values in USD](https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/cryptocurrency/listings/latest?start=1&limit=5000&convert=USD).     *Be sure to replace the API Key in sample code with your own and use API domain `pro-api.coinmarketcap.com` or use the test API Key `b54bcf4d-1bca-4e8e-9a24-22ff2c3d462c` for `sandbox-api.coinmarketcap.com` testing with our sandbox.coinmarketcap.com environment. Please note that our sandbox api has mock data and should not be used in your application.*
